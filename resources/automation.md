# Week 1; 5TH Jan.: Unveiling the Wonders of Space Automation
## Introduction and Libraries Import
The script commences with an essential section where it imports various libraries. This action is pivotal for the script's functionality, as it brings in powerful tools such as datetime for handling time-related operations, random for generating random data, json for working with JSON data, os for interacting with the operating system, and requests for making HTTP requests. Furthermore, it imports specific modules from the geopy library, enhancing its geocoding capabilities.

## Configuration File and Preliminary Text
The script, being a robust automation tool, establishes a structured foundation with the pre_text_for_config() function. This function generates a preliminary text intended for the config.txt file. The config.txt file plays a crucial role in tracking the automation processes. The explanatory comments within this function underscore its significance. The file not only serves as a guide for the automation program but also maintains a count of completed tasks, a representation of which is done through the innovative use of a "pipe-dash" character. This detailed explanation within the code showcases a meticulous approach to documentation and transparency in code design.

## Config File Creation
Continuing with the theme of configuration, the script meticulously checks for the existence of the config.txt file through the create_config_file_if_not_exist() function.

```
# Update Data File
update_data_file(text_string)

# Update Image Information File
update_image_json_file(apod_info)

# Save Image File
filename = save_apod_to_file(apod_info)
```

These functions ensure that the gathered information is not only presented in a human-readable format but also archived systematically. The script writes to data files, updates records of automation successes, and even saves the APOD image to a storage location, adding a layer of persistence to its operations.

SEE YOU IN WEEK 3.



# Week 3; 19TH Jan.:Storage Location Determination
## Adaptive Storage Organization
One of the key features introduced in Week 3 is the adaptive storage location determination mechanism. This functionality aims to dynamically organize data and image files based on the current day number. The purpose is to maintain a well-structured storage hierarchy, enhancing the script's scalability and organization.

## Understanding the Need
As the automation process progresses, data and image files accumulate. To prevent these files from becoming overwhelming and to facilitate easy retrieval, the script intelligently calculates an appropriate storage location for these files. This determination is driven by the current day number, providing a systematic way to categorize files over time.

## Initial Setup
The storage location determination process begins with the calculation of an index. This index represents the week in which the current day falls. The idea is to group files into weekly folders, ensuring a manageable structure.

```
index = 1
while (curr_day_num > 7):
    index += 1
    curr_day_num -= 7
```

Here, a while loop is employed to iterate through the weeks. The index variable increments each time a full week has passed, and the curr_day_num (current day number) decreases accordingly. This loop effectively calculates the week index for the current day.

## Storage Directory Creation
Once the index is determined, the script moves on to create the storage directory. The directory is named in a structured manner to reflect the week number.

```
save_dir = "output/week_" + str(index)
try:
    os.mkdir(save_dir)
except:
    pass
finally:
    os.chdir(save_dir)
```

Here, the os.mkdir() function attempts to create the directory. If the directory already exists, the script gracefully moves on without raising an error. Finally, the script changes its working directory to the newly created (or existing) directory.

## Why Adaptive Storage?
The adaptive storage organization ensures that as the automation process continues over time, files are not lumped into a single directory but are instead organized into weekly folders. This structure makes it easier for users to navigate and manage the growing volume of data and image files.

### Integration with Main Orchestrator (go() Function)
The storage location determination process seamlessly integrates into the main orchestrator, the go() function. After fetching the current day number from the config.txt file, the script utilizes this information to determine the appropriate storage location before executing subsequent tasks.

## Conclusion of Storage Location Determination
Week 3 introduces a thoughtful approach to storage organization, addressing the need for adaptive categorization of data and image files. By dynamically determining storage locations based on the current day number, the script ensures a well-organized and scalable structure for long-term use. This adaptive storage mechanism aligns with best practices for data management, showcasing the script's commitment to efficiency and user-friendly file organization.
