 ## Space junk: Why is debris from rockets and satellites orbiting Earth a problem?
Thousands of pieces of space debris, also known as space junk, are orbiting Earth — posing a significant threat to satellites, spacecraft and astronauts.

# INTRODUCTION
Space debris — known colloquially as space junk — is the name that scientists give to the thousands of pieces of broken satellites and spacecraft that clog Earth's orbit. Space junk can be as small as a paint fleck or as large as an abandoned rocket launch vehicle; no matter the size, orbital debris pose a significant threat to the astronauts and spacecraft that work in Earth's orbit, according to NASA.

The amount of space junk in orbit increases hand-in-hand with the growth of the space industry on Earth. On March 10, a group of international researchers writing in the journal Science raised the alarm on the growing problem of space junk, calling for a legally-binding treaty to "help protect Earth's orbit" before it becomes irreparably polluted with debris. 

### What is space junk?
Space junk refers to any human-made debris left in orbit around Earth. This includes fully intact satellites that have run out of power and been left in orbit after the end of their missions, as well as broken chunks of machinery created when larger objects collide. Even tiny chips of paint that have been ripped off of rockets count as space junk.

### How much space junk is there right now?
The United States Space Surveillance Network currently tracks more than 23,000 pieces of space junk that are larger than a softball. This includes about 3,000 defunct satellites that have been left to decay in orbit, according to the Natural History Museum of London.

However, most pieces of orbital debris are far too small to be tracked. Researchers estimate that there are more than 100 trillion untracked pieces of space junk in Earth orbit, according to the Science study. The vast majority of this untracked debris is likely less than 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) wide, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).

# THE GROWING THREAT OF SPACE DEBRIS.
The threat of space debris arises from the increasing accumulation of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments generated by collisions in Earth's orbit. As human activities in space, such as satellite launches and space exploration missions, continue to rise, so does the potential for collisions and the creation of more debris. This poses risks to operational satellites, spacecraft, and the overall sustainability of activities in space. Managing and mitigating space debris has become critical concerns to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration and satellite operations.

### The International Space Station and its Vulnerability
The International Space Station, a multinational collaborative effort, serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory. It is a crucial platform for scientific research, technology development, and international cooperation in space. However, its location in low Earth orbit (LEO) puts it at risk of colliding with space debris.
The ISS orbits the Earth at an average altitude of approximately 42 kilometers (261 miles), where the density of space debris is relatively high. Even small fragments can cause significant damage due to their immense velocities. The threat of collisions poses a serious challenge to the sustainability and safety of the ISS and its crew.

## PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM SPACE DEBRIS.
The proliferation of space debris poses several significant problems:
**1. Collision Risk:** The growing amount of space debris increases the risk of collisions with operational satellites, spacecraft, and other valuable assets in orbit. These collisions can lead to further fragmentation and create additional debris, exacerbating the problem.

**2. Satellite and Spacecraft Safety:** Operational satellites and spacecraft are at risk of damage from space debris, potentially impacting their functionality or causing mission failure. Protecting these assets becomes more challenging as the amount of debris in orbit increases.

**3. Space Sustainability:** The sustainability of space activities is compromised as the density of space debris rises. The risk of collisions makes it difficult to plan and execute space missions without potential interference from debris, limiting the usability of certain orbital regions.

**4. International Cooperation:** Space debris is a global issue that requires international cooperation for effective solutions. Establishing guidelines, regulations, and collaborative efforts to address space debris is crucial to mitigating the problem and ensuring the responsible use of outer space.

**5. Kessler Syndrome:** The Kessler Syndrome is a theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit is so high that collisions could generate a self-sustaining cascade of debris, making certain regions of space unusable for future satellites and missions.

**6. Space Sustainability Policies:** There is a need for clear and enforceable policies on space debris mitigation and disposal. Improved practices for satellite end-of-life disposal and guidelines for preventing the creation of new debris during mission operations are essential.

Efforts are underway to address these problems, including the development of technologies for active debris removal, international collaboration on space debris tracking, and the establishment of guidelines for responsible space activities.

   ## SOLUTIONS
**1.	Orbital Manoeuvres** Spacecraft, including the ISS, can perform orbital manoeuvres to avoid potential collisions with known space debris. These manoeuvres involve adjusting the spacecraft's trajectory to ensure a safe distance from the debris.

**2.	Shielding and Hardening:** Designing spacecraft and space station components with shielding materials can help minimize the damage caused by smaller debris. Additionally, engineers are exploring ways to make spacecraft more robust and resilient to withstand impacts.

**3.	Active Debris Removal (ADR):** Developing and deploying technologies for actively removing large and dangerous space debris objects from orbit can help mitigate the existing problem. Concepts include robotic systems, harpoons, or nets to capture and de-orbit debris.

**4.	Improved Tracking and Surveillance:** Enhancing our ability to track and predict the trajectories of space debris is crucial for avoiding collisions. Advanced tracking systems allow space agencies to provide timely warnings and plan orbital manoeuvres when necessary.

**5.	International Guidelines and Regulations:** Establishing clear and enforceable guidelines for responsible space activities is crucial. International agreements on space debris mitigation, satellite design, and end-of-life disposal practices can promote responsible behaviour in space.

**6.	Educational and Awareness Initiatives:** Promoting awareness about the consequences of space debris and the importance of responsible space practices can encourage the global space community to adopt measures for debris mitigation. Education programs can target both industry professionals and the public.

**7.	Research and Development:** Continued investment in research and development is essential for the advancement of technologies and methodologies related to space debris mitigation. This includes improving tracking capabilities, developing cost-effective removal methods, and finding sustainable solutions.

**8.	Global Collaboration:** Space debris is a global challenge that requires collaboration among space-faring nations. Encouraging cooperation on space debris tracking, information sharing, and joint efforts for debris removal can enhance the effectiveness of solutions.
